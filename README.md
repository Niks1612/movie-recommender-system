# movie-recommender-system

The goal of this project is to recommend movies to users based on the features of movies they have shown interest in. For instance, if a user likes the movie "Inception," the system will recommend movies with similar genres, directors, actors, or other content-related attributes.

The recommendation system is built using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit for building a web interface. PyCharm is used as the IDE to develop, test, and run the application.

# Technologies and Libraries Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the entire system.<br/>
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.<br/>
Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks such as vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF) and similarity calculations.<br/>
Streamlit: A Python library for creating interactive web applications. This is used to build the front end of the recommendation system, allowing users to select movies and receive recommendations.<br/>
Requests: Used to fetch movie posters and additional details from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.<br/>
Pickle: To save and load models and data files efficiently.<br/>
